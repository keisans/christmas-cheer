  A bland retelling of Cinderella without any of the magic or charm. This movie
  has some mildly fun twists but overall fails to generate much cheer

A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish stars Laura Marano as 'Kat,' as a traditional Cinderella figure after her wildlife-adventure-loving father inexplicably married her step-mother before passing away. Since this is the fifth in the *A Cinderella Story* series, they decided to spice it up by removing any magical elements, replacing it with the seeming inability of teenagers to recognize each other while wearing wigs.

Kat and her prince Dominic both work at a holiday themed park and singing holiday telegram company. Dominic plays santa while Kat is an elf.
